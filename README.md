# Gym Membership System

This is a small Python project made for my university coursework.  
It is a simple program that manages gym members. The system lets the user add members, view all members, search for someone, delete members, and sort the list by name.  
The project is beginner-friendly because the goal was to practise Python basics and learn how to use GitHub.

## Features
- add member
- view members
- search for a member
- delete a member
- sort members by name (bubble sort)
- simple menu system

## How to run
just run the file gym_membership.py in python.
the menu will show up and you can pick options.

## Goal
mainly learning data structures and algorithms and using github properly.
